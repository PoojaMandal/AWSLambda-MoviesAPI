# Serverless using AWSLambda Python-MoviesAPI

Developed a serverless movie API using AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, and DynamoDB. The API provides RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations on movie data, including retrieving a list of movies, fetching details of a specific movie by ID, adding new movies, updating existing movie details, and deleting movies from the database.

Here's the list of APIS: 
create movie -       https://en6jiioo60.execute-api.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/movie
get movie by id -    https://en6jiioo60.execute-api.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/movie/{id}
get list of movies - https://en6jiioo60.execute-api.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/movie
update movie by id - https://en6jiioo60.execute-api.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/movie/{id}
delete movie by id - https://en6jiioo60.execute-api.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/movie/{id}
